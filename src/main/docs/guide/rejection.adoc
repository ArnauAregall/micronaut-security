Micronaut allows the customization of the response that is sent when a request is not authorized to access a resource, or is not authenticated and the resource requires authentication.

When a request is rejected, the security filter emits an api:security.authentication.AuthorizationException[]. The default implementation (api:security.authentication.DefaultAuthorizationExceptionHandler[]) simply returns an empty response with either a 401 or 403 status code depending on whether the request was authenticated or not.

For those using session based authorization, the default implementation is overridden by api:security.session.SessionAuthorizationExceptionHandler[]. The session exception handler redirects based on the session configuration.

To fully customize the behavior, replace the relevant bean with your own implementation.

For example:
[source,java]
----
include::{testssecurityjwt}/rejection/MyRejectionHandler.java[tag=clazz,indent=0]
