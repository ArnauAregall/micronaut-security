This section will document breaking changes that may happen during milestone or release candidate releases, as well as major releases eg (1.x.x -> 2.x.x).

== 2.0.0

* All deprecations present in 1.3.x have been removed.

* The legacy rejection handler in the session module, which was enabled by default, has been removed. The setting `micronaut.security.session.legacy-rejection-handler` no longer has any effect and is equivalent to the behavior of `false` in previous versions.

* The api:security.authentication.Authentication API has changed to ensure each value in the attributes map is `Serializable`
