If you wish for a particular method to be invoked when a bean is constructed then you can use the `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/lifecycle/V8Engine.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsdir}/lifecycle/V8Engine.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The `PostConstruct` annotation is imported
<2> A field is defined that requires initialization
<3> A method is annotated with `@PostConstruct` and will be invoked once the object is constructed and fully injected.
