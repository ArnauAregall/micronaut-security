Micronaut supports authentication with OAuth 2.0 servers, including support for the OpenID standard.


The easiest way to get started is by configuring a provider that supports OpenID. Platforms such as https://developer.okta.com[Okta], https://auth0.com[Auth0], https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[AWS Cognito], https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak], and https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google] are common examples.

Once you create an application client with a provider, you will get a client id and a client secret. The client id and secret combined with the issuer URL is all that is needed to enable authentication with an OpenID provider.

For example, to configure Google as a provider:

[source, yaml]
