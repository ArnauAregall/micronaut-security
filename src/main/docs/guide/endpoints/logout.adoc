You can enable the logout endpoint with configuration:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.endpoints.LogoutControllerConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

The behavior of the controller is delegated to a link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/handlers/LogoutHandler.html[LogoutHandler] implementation. There are default implementations provided for JWT Cookie and Session based authentication storage.

TIP: If you are using JWT authentication not stored in a cookie, you may not need to invoke the `/logout` endpoint. Since logging out normally means simply deleting the JWT token int the client.
